            For example, in the hex color #944e30, red has a value of 94,
            green has a value of 4e, and blue has a value of 30.
            These three values correspond to the decimal values 148, 78, and 48,
            which together form a chestnut brown color.
            Also, there is a shorthand three-digit form, when combining the duplicate digits into one.
            For example, #000000 (black) can also be written as #000.
