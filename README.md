# JavaScript-Crash-Course-Morgan-2024

This **JavaScript** programming crash course with an introduction to libraries **Tone.js** (for generating music) and **D3.js** (for visualizing data interactively) is based on the book *"JavaScript Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming"* by Nick Morgan published by *No Starch Press* in 2024. 

Where possible, I provided comparisons with the **Python** syntax. In addition to language syntax and code examples, the course is completed by the following projects:
- [a game created (without and) with OOP](https://vizhub.com/ax-va/966f246e8d2b45ccaf84a5adccafda33)
- [a nice song for nice Tanya](https://vizhub.com/ax-va/c5bf2c12ce1a494ea7b8bc249a62357d)
- [a visualization of data fetched via the GitHub Search API](https://vizhub.com/ax-va/0865b6bcbd4345d693c9569e3d3b800f?mode=embed)
