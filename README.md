# JavaScript-Crash-Course-Morgan-2024

This **JavaScript** programming crash course including an introduction to libraries **Tone.js** (for generating music) and **D3.js** (for visualising data interactively) is based on the book *"JavaScript Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming"* by Nick Morgan published by No Starch Press in 2024. 

Additional to the language syntax and code examples, these projects complete the course
