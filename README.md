# JavaScript-Crash-Course-Morgan-2024

This **JavaScript** programming crash course with an introduction to libraries **Tone.js** (for generating music) and **D3.js** (for visualizing data interactively) is based on the book *"JavaScript Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming"* by Nick Morgan published by *No Starch Press* in 2024. 

In addition to language syntax and code examples, the course is completed by the following projects:
- the (Ping) Pong game without and with OOP
- a nice song for nice Tanya
- a visualization of data fetched via the GitHub Search API
