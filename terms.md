**control structures = conditionals and loops**

**Event bubbling = Triggering an event on an element causes triggering the event on all its ancestors**

When an event is triggered on an element, 
it also gets triggered on all the element's ancestors (parents, parents of parents, and so on).
If an ancestor has a separate event handler attached to it, it would also receive the event.
An event "bubbles up" through the DOM, from the innermost element to the outermost element.

**Event delegation**

This lets us attach a single event handler, rather than using a separate handler for each DOM element.

**JSON = JavaScript Object Notation**

**PEMDAS = parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction (the order of operations)**

**Prototype-Based Inheritance = an older system than classes in JavaScript that still is used**

That consists of 
1) a constructor function (a regular, standalone function), and
2) a prototype (a constructor's object-property that instances should be modeled after).

The JavaScript's class-based inheritance is a *syntactic sugar* for prototype-based inheritance.
