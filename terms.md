**control structures = conditionals and loops**

**JSON = JavaScript Object Notation**

**PEMDAS = parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction (the order of operations)**

**Prototype-Based Inheritance = an older system than classes in JavaScript that still is used.**

That consists of 
1) a constructor function (a regular, standalone function) 
2) a prototype (a constructor's object-property that instances should be modeled after).

The JavaScript's class-based inheritance is a *syntactic sugar* for prototype-based inheritance.
